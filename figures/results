Trial 1 involved running PCA and RPCA over all the images in the Yale B face dataset, and can be considered a failure. Neither PCA nor RPCA produced eigenfaces that were able to succesfully distinguish between individuals in the dataset. A look at the low rank images (in person24AfterRPCAtrial1.gif) produced clearly shows that instead of learning that a low rank representation that highlighted individuals, it appears that the algorithm instead learned that a low rank representation that accurately clusters by lighting conditions!

For Trial 2, the same techniques were applied only to those images with what we would consider 'good' lighting conditions (while they varied in the position of the light source, the images that consist of half or fully-shadowed faces were not included, in particular this means the images removed were 000E+90, 070E-35, 110E+15, 035E+65, 070E-35, 110E-20, 050E+00, 070E+45, 110E-20, 050E-40, 070E+45, 110E+40, 050E-40, 085E-20, 110E+40, 060E-20, 085E+20, 110E+65, 060E+20, 085E-20, 110E+65, 060E-20, 085E+20, 120E+00, 060E+20, 095E+00, 120E+00, 070E+00, 095E+00, 130E+20, 070E+00, 110E+15, 130E+20). This lowered the number of viable images from 2414 to 1098 (or from 64 images to 29 images per individual). This led PCA and RPCA to both improve performance, being capable of producing projections with silhouette scores > 0, but still did not lead them to outperform the silhouette score of the original dataset.

For Trial 3, the same attempt was made with only the 'best' 12 images from the yale face dataset for each individual, with the best being handpicked as (+000E+00, +005E-10, -015E+20, +000E-20, -010E+00, -020E-10, +000E+20, +010E+00, +020E+10, -005E-10, -010E-20, -005E+10, +010E-20). In this circumstance, PCA did eventually recover 34 eigenfaces that cluster the data well (as well as the original vectors clustered themselves), and interestingly, RPCA performed worse on the data than PCA!

Overall it appears that RPCA does not provide robustness in the sense that is most needed for the creation of eigenfaces. Instead of finding the low rank facial structure of each individual (and treating the varying lighting conditions as errors) it instead finds the specularities in the pictures as errors. This leads to it not producing eigenfaces that are much better than PCA itself at distinguishing unique faces. In some sense, RPCA is a better 'image filter' than it is a facial recognition strategy here, it can clean up images by removing shine and other image artifacts, but does not provide us a robust recognition mechanism when faced with a large number of images under varied lighting conditions. When the images are under varied lighting conditions, it performs better than PCA, but not much, and when the lighting conditions are near-optimal, the attempt to find the low rank component loses information that allows PCA to produce eigenfaces that perform better than RPCA!
